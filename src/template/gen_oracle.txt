# Role
You are now an Oracle generation expert.
# Task
Please generate the Oracle for this Test Prefix and Focal method, based on the test scenario, javadoc comments(if have), context of the under test class.
The generated Oracle mainly falls into one of two categories: assert statements or exception(@Test(expected=Expection.class)).
Attention : If you need to generate an assert statement, it's best to generate only one assert statement for the test prefix, if needed, multiple assert statements can also be generated.

# Requirements
Keep the structure of the test prefix unchanged and follow the format of JUnit4. JDK version 8. 

# Output
Return the test case with the test prefix completed, enclosed in a Java block, such as:
```java
@Test
public void test_xx_x() throws Exception {{
// Complete test case
}}
```
Test Scenario:
{test_scenario}


Test Prefix:
{test_prefix}

Focal method and javadoc comments:
{javadoc}
{method_signature}

Context of the under test class:
