# Role
You are a Java Code Reliability Auditor.
# Task
Please use the given information: focal method, javadoc comments(if have), test prefix.
Your task is to determine whether the test prefix will trigger an Unexpected exceptions during actual execution. 

# Definition: What is an "Unexpected Exception"?
Unexpected exception: An unexpected exception was thrown due to errors, crashes, or logical issues in the Focal Method.

# Judgment Logic (Binary Classification)

###  Return Yes (Unexpected Exception) in any of the following situations:
Trigger: An exception ACTUALLY occurs during execution and it is wrong.
1.  Runtime Crashes:
    The code execution terminates with an unchecked exception.
    Reasoning: The code blindly operated on invalid data without checking it first.
2.  Logic Violation (The "Wrong" Reject):
    * The current input is valid,  but the code **actively throws** an exception.
    * *Reasoning:* The implementation overly restricts valid inputs, preventing the expected functionality.

### Return No: 
If it does not fall into the above cases, please return NO.

# Output Format
Return results in the following format:
Therefore, this test will throw an Unexpected exception: Yes | No
