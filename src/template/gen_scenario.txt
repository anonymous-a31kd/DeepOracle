# Role
You are an expert in software testing. 
# Task
There is now a test scenario inference task.
Please infer the test scenario or exception handling scenario based on the javadoc comment, the focal method, 
and the context of the focal test class for the test prefix.

# Requirement:
The test scenario mainly includes the following three aspects at a conceptual level:
1. What behavior the test is exercising.
2. Which objects are involved and what their roles are.
3. What the high-level goal or purpose of this test is.
Focus on what the code SHOULD DO (based on Javadoc or standard coding conventions) not what the potentially buggy code ACTUALLY DOES.

# Contextual Information
Test prefix:
{test_prefix}

Focal_method and javadoc comments:
{javadoc}
{focal_method}

Under Test class context:
{context}

# Output Format
The answer should include the test scenario and category in plaintext block, such as: 
```plaintext
Test scenario:
Category: 
```
